# EZStorage
Storage: Simplified

## Version
For Minecraft 1.8.9

##Description
EZStorage introduces an early-game storage system that scales and evolves as players progress. Want to put 100,000 Cobblestone in 1 slot? No problem. Blocks in the mod can add a search bar, a crafting grid, additional storage, and more. Also includes JEI integration for 1-click crafting from the system's internal inventory!
 
##Blocks

* Storage Core - This is the core of your storage system. Click on this block to open the GUI, and add adjacent blocks to expand. Each system can only have 1 Storage Core. This block can only be broken if it contains no items.
* Storage Box - Tier 1 storage add-on. This increases the storage capacity of the Storage Core by a small amount.
* Condensed Storage Box - Tier 2 storage add-on.
* Hyper Storage Box - Tier 3 storage add-on
* Input Port - Items can by automatically be put into the storage system by piping them into any side of this block
* Output Port - Quickly extracts all items from the system into the block above the Output Port
* Crafting Box - This adds a crafting grid to the GUI of your Storage Core (compatible with JEI + clicking for easy crafting from the internal inventory)
* Search Box - This adds a search bar to the GUI of your Storage Core
